# Project Improvement Suggestions

Here are some suggestions for potential enhancements to the project, categorized by area.

## 1. CI/CD Pipeline

Enhance the existing GitHub Actions workflow to improve code quality and catch bugs earlier.

-   **Automated Testing:** Add steps to the workflow to run backend tests (`phpunit`) and frontend tests on every push. This ensures that new changes don't break existing functionality.
-   **Linting and Static Analysis:** Add steps to run a linter (like ESLint for the frontend and Pint for the backend) and a static analysis tool (like PHPStan for the backend). This will automatically enforce a consistent code style and catch potential errors.

## 2. Code Quality and Maintainability

-   **Consistent Code Style:** Introduce code formatters like **Prettier** for the frontend and **Pint** (which is included with Laravel) for the backend. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to run them automatically.
-   **Backend Static Analysis:** Introduce **PHPStan** to the backend. It's a static analysis tool that can find bugs in your code without you having to write tests.

## 3. Security

-   **Audit Dependencies:** Regularly run `npm audit` in the `front-end` directory and `composer audit` in the `back-end` directory to scan for and fix known security vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.

## 4. Performance

-   **Backend Caching:** For frequently accessed data that doesn't change often, implement caching on the backend. Laravel has excellent built-in support for caching, which can significantly reduce database load and speed up API responses.

## 5. User Experience

-   **Loading States:** In the frontend application, implement clear loading indicators (like spinners or skeletons) whenever fetching data from the backend. This provides immediate feedback to the user and improves the perceived performance of the application.
